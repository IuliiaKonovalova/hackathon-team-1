# Project Overview

Potential advertisers are encouraged to get in touch to offer their product, service, or experience to site users, to enhance the options available.
A site for those searching for an alternative gift idea for their partner. 

Site users are invited to answer questions about the personality traits and behaviour of their partner and are presented with gift ideas based on their response.

The site is free to use, and mobile responsive.

# User Experience Design

## Strategy

Developed for those who wish to make a special purchase for their partner, regardless of whether for Valentine's Day, a birthday, or anniversary, the site has been designed with a simple to use format that guides the user through a set of closed-option questions about their partner's likes and dislikes, ultimately leading them to a selection of suitable gift ideas.

The site does not sell the gifts directly but provides links to international suppliers. At present, the site does not have a geographical focus, but rather is available for international users. All prices have been converted to USD to make for a simple user experience.

Potential advertisers are encouraged to get in touch to offer their product, service, or experience to site users, to enhance the options available.
